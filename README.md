In the last few weeks, there have been tremendous encouragement from COVID-19 vaccine trials. Pfizer and Moderna preliminary results indicate an efficacy of 95% and 94.5%, respectively. With more vaccinations due in the coming months to submit preliminary results, it seems we will begin to have some hope of returning to normal life. 
Consequently, we will study the vaccine feedback of people (positive , neutral or negative) after the first tests.<br>
